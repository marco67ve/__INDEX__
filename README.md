# BASIC Projects Index

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a central index for my retro BASIC projects, written mainly between the mid-1980s and early 2000s.  

I started programming as a teenager on early PCs (8086, 386) using dialects like GW-BASIC, QuickBASIC, and later QB64.  
These projects represent both my learning journey and the way games and tools were built in that era — with simple code, ASCII graphics, and a lot of creativity.

Runtime requirements note

All .BAS programs in this archive were originally developed using Microsoft QuickBASIC, while preserving full compatibility with QBasic (interpreter).
However, to achieve the performance and smoothness intended by the author, it is strongly recommended to compile them into .EXE using a genuine QuickBASIC compiler (version 4.0, 4.5, 7.0 or 7.1 / PDS).
When compiled, programs run approximately 7–8 times faster than under interpreted execution.
All sources are also compatible with QB64: simply comment out or reduce any delay line (WAIT, TIMER, SLEEP or timed LOOP) to match the higher speed of modern 32/64-bit systems.

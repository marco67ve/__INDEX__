# BASIC Projects Index

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a central index for my retro BASIC projects, written mainly between the mid-1980s and early 2000s.  

I started programming as a teenager on early PCs (8086, 386) using dialects like GW-BASIC, QuickBASIC, and later QB64.  
These projects represent both my learning journey and the way games and tools were built in that era — with simple code, ASCII graphics, and a lot of creativity.
